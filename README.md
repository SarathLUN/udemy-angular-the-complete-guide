# 03 Course Project - The Basics

### 048 Setting up the Application

- When I try to add bootstrap css framework into `angular.json`, I got error.

```json
{
  [...]
  "styles": [
    "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "src/styles.css"
  ],
  [...]
}
```

- compile error:

```shell
An unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/sarath/Public/Angular-Udemy/node_modules'
See "/private/var/folders/jm/q6lxzs_x4dx17yxzl3frkwpr0000gn/T/ng-3ixqcJ/angular-errors.log" for further details.

```

- this new version of Angular, the app start at the root folder of the project instead of src, therefore, the relative path of bootstrap not required `"../node_modules/..."`.
- so the correct configuration should be

```json
{
  [...]
  "styles": [
    "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "src/styles.css"
  ],
  [...]
}
```
